Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.
It followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule;
I made the children laugh and play,
To see a lamb at school.
And so the teacher turned him out,
But still he lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
Till Mary did appear.
And then he ran to her and laid,
His head upon her arm,
As if he said, Im not afraid 
Youll shield me from all harm.
What makes the lamb love Mary so?
The little children cry;
O Mary loves the lamb, you know,
The teacher did reply.
And you each gentle animal,
In confidence may bind,
And make it follow at your call,
If you are always kind.


Pussycat, Pussycat, where have you been?
Ive been to London to visit the Queen;
Pussycat, Pussycat, what did you there?
I frightened a little mouse under a chair.


Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full.
One for my master, one for my dame;
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane.
Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?

Jack and Jill went up the hill,
To fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.
Then up Jack got and home did trot,
As fast as he could caper;
To Old Dame Dob, who patched his knob,
With vinegar and brown paper.
With vinegar and brown paper.
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full.


Cobbler, Cobbler mend my shoe,
Get it done by half past two.
If half past two is much too late,
Get it done by half past eight.


Hickety Pickety my black hen,
She lays eggs for gentlemen.
Sometimes 9 and sometimes 10.
Hickety Pickety, my black hen.


Hot-cross buns! Hot-cross buns!
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot-cross buns.
If you have no daughters,
Give them to your sons.
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot cross buns!
But if you have none of these little elves,
Then you may eat them all yourselves.

Star light, star bright,
First star I see tonight.
I wish I may, I wish I might,
Have the wish I wish tonight.
